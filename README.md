## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was a good simple project to focus and build upon my knowledge of semantic HTML.

### Continued development

Semantic HTML is an area that I want to continue to learn until it is second nature and I don't have to think which element is best for each situation.
